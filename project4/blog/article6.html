				My first attempt at Ys III: Wanders from Ys lasted about an hour and a half. I played it on the Super Nintendo one of the 16-bit remakes of the 1989 PC-8801/9801 original released in 1991. That was a mistake. The hit detection of this port is very unpredictable, adding a random element to combat that was never intended. I suffered many game overs after Adol’s sword whiffed straight through the monster I was fighting.


				Switching over to the Sega Genesis port did the trick. It was far more precise and predictable, making most game overs my own fault. Some game overs were due to enemy placement, like right after a screen transition or on a platform I needed to jump to. The damage would feel unfair, but I learned to accept I would get damaged in certain cases and need to heal with an harb. 



				<b>Difficulties with Difficutly:</b>

				The difficulty curve was typical of RPGs: difficult to start, moderate-to-easy middle and late game, difficult end game. Grinding made Ys III’s mid-game easy, but the low level-cap made the end game hard. The final boss also required a precise half-jump that took a few tries to master. However, most other encounter strategies revolved around completely avoiding mechanics. Simply ducking while attacking was often the best tactic. For example, you can stand close to Merland and avoid all projectiles and lightening, rather than using a hit-and-run tactic that one might expect.


				For many of the other bosses, it is simply a matter of damaging them faster than they damage Adol by using the power or shield ring.

				 

				<b>Remake, Take Two:</b>

				After finishing the Genesis port, I played through the PlayStation Portable remake, Ys: The Oath of Felghana. The normal difficulty is easier than Ys III, if ever so slightly, but gives a reasonably similar experience to the Genesis port in terms of difficulty. The very easy difficulty changes the game completely, turning it into a fast-playing power fantasy action role-playing game. On any difficulty, the game plays differently enough from the original that it feels like a brand-new game. Not that this is a bad thing at all.



				<b>Recommendation:</b>

				I found the 16-bit ports of Ys III too tedious and annoying at points to recommend, but I do not suggest avoiding them entirely. Ys: The Oath of Felghana, while inauthentic to the original in many ways, is the better playthrough. Ys: The Oath of Felghana was a fun port with a PlayStation 1 presentation.


				<b>Bonus Round:</b>

				This game has myriad ports. I suggest checking out Hardcorgaming101’s page for a screenshot comparison.
