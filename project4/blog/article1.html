			My mid-life (mid-pandemic) crisis buy was a CRT. You know, one of those old tvs the size of a Buick. I picked up the 13” Panasonic OmniVision PV-C1320 built in 2000 off of Ebay for one main reason: I used one in the past. The PC-C1320 is consumer grade CRT with few frills. It has a built in VCR and FM/AM tuner, coaxial RF and composite inputs, and mono sound. Also, it has a 3.5m headphone jack.


			It was perhaps a tad expensive for what it was, but I just wanted to see it again. I remember coming by my original Panasonic when my younger brother was not using it. Funny enough, I did not use it for playing games and only had it for a few years. Still, I watched a lot of television on this TV for those few years I had it. It was on this TV that I first discovered Stargate SG1 and Atlantis. I also watched Friends on it, weekly. I would guess I watched The Simpsons reruns daily.

			If you want just any-old CRT, check Craigslist first. You might even find one for free. On Ebay, you can expect to pay prices sometimes greater than when these TVs were new, especially if they need to be shipped. Some models are listing at $500, but I hope that is pandemic pricing. Once you reach that price point, you probably should be considering a Professional Video Monitor (PVM). Also, be wary of “Retro” or “Rare” labels in listings. These tend to be listed a lot more than the TVs are truly worth.


			<b>Blur is Good:</b>

			Sometimes pixel-perfect integer scaling looks great. Pixel art games, in general, can look great either way. I prefer the overall look of the CRT. Plugging in my Super Nintendo was a revelation. Not only was it brighter than I remembered, but the contrast was greater too. The blacks are far darker on it than on my PC monitors.


			PlayStation 1 games with prerendered backgrounds do not hold up well with scaling, integer or otherwise. Displaying the backgrounds and polygonal model at their intended 240p (320 x 224), helps the characters and backgrounds mesh. Of course, 240p is far too small without scaling. It does not feel authentic to the original experience, even if played on a PSP or PS Vita. Integer scaling helps keep the background and polygons appropriately pixelated, but the edges have very pronounced stair stepping on diagonal lines.

			Final Fantasy IX’s current generation remaster really demonstrates some of the problems.

			The upscaling blur-filter on the backgrounds is sub-par, and the characters do not blend terribly well due to their comparatively high-resolution polygons. Fixing this problem on a modern flat panel is very hard. If Square Enix could have re-rendered original backgrounds in 1080p or 4k, it would have been interesting to see how it looked. However, they did not have access to those assets.


			On a CRT, the natural gaussian blur works with the image. It is a no-cost real time anti-aliasing. To my eyes, 240p on a CRT is a better, cleaner image overall, even at the cost of fine details. It is a little hard to believe that this tiny picture on the left looks better than the one above, unless you see it in person.


			<b> VGA and PVM: </b>

			After the pure pleasure of the CRT, I could not help myself. I also picked up a Dell VGA monitor. I have experimented with 2560 x 240 at 120 hz, and the scanlines are just too sharp to feel like an authentic experience. 480p looks decent. It even has scanlines (two per pixel for 240p). It is not the best for the Retro Resolution, but not too shabby for 480i+ content, like the Playstation 2


			Though I do not have one, Professional Video Monitors also produce extra sharp scanlines. I understand the appeal. When the PlayStation was new hardware, I did everything in my power to make it as sharp and clear as possible. I will have to revisit the subject when I get my hands on one, though they are a bit cost prohibitive now. And for my money, a good-enough consumer CRT with a composite input is the authentic retro experience.
