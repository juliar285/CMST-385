			<b>I Wasted My Time</b>


			Not the 28 hours I spent playing, but the however-many hours I spent worrying about all the choices. I am not sure how good the gameplay and story needed to be to make all that worry worth it, but I walked away from Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire a little disappointed.



			<b>Improvements:</b>


			POE2 is a fine game. A good game. I have a few thoughts that would have improved the game for me:


			A default main character, with the option to roll a completely custom one. I use the default Shepherd when I play Mass Effect. I use cannon names for JRPGs. If I am given the freedom to create characters, I will do it until the cows come home. I love making new characters. But sometimes, like in this case, I need to just get into the game.


			A difficulty free prologue. I do not like difficulty settings. I am happy to bang my head against Dark Souls because I know I can not turn the difficulty down. I like games like Super Mario Odyssey because I know they are going to just be easy fun romps. The thing I struggle with the most about difficulties is that they are arbitrary and subjective. This makes picking them before playing seem utterly ridiculous. Let the first island have the same difficulty for everyone. When the narrative breaks between the prologue and act 1, ask the player if they want the game to be harder or easier.


			<b>Legit Crits:</b>


			My first two points are not criticisms, per se. Just things that I would have liked. However, I do have a big criticism: the writing. Too much side quest, too little main quest. The story of a rampaging God is exciting and interesting, so why does it take up so little of the games run time? Instead of dealing with this VERY urgent matter, your character is running errands for bickering factions trying to win their approval. Strangely, I think the game would have been better off with no main quest because the focus on the factions is not that bad on its own.


			Characters are also a little uneven. Eder is a lot of fun but he can be a real jerk and no one seems to notice. I do not know what is wrong with some of the writing, it is hard to put my finger on it. It is not immature, exactly. It just feels like it came from a D&D session, rather than being finely polished.


			<b>Final Thoughts:</b>


			This one has been a roller coaster. POE2â€™s peaks are very high. And, to be fair, I have been awfully nitpicky. I would still recommend checking it out if you are into CRPGs (and have played the first one). I would especially recommend it to fans of Critical Role as they are everywhere. 


			Just play on classic or easier and look for challenge in a different game. I finished on Veteran, but the game gets very easy as your characters level up. You spend as much time in dialogue or narrative sequences as you do in combat, and despite my complaints it is the real meat of the game.
