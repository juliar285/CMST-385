			The Touryst got a lot of praise for its sleek retro-yet-modern aesthetic, and it runs incredibly well on both the Switch and a modern gaming PC. The voxel artwork does a great job of looking like a 16-bit game come to life. The overall design philosophy of the game recalls retro gaming in a way that makes it very special.


			Like a lot of indies, the game is short. Five hours or so if you do the minimal amount of work required to finish it (and skip the arcade!). It would be quite lovely to play through on a rainy Saturday afternoon. 100%-ing the game should only require a few more hours, though I managed to escape the trap of completionism this time. The length felt intentional though, as many of the jumping segments were rather hard. If there had been many more, I would not have enjoyed the game as much.


			<b>There is Little Combat:</b>

			The Touryst feels a bit like classic Zelda without Moblins. I found nothing that I would truly describe as combat in this game. There are bosses, but they are semi-abstract block monsters that are more puzzles than fights. I have been bemoaning that nearly all of gaming is combat simulations lately; it can be a bit boring. This made the focus on exploration, silly puzzles, and some tricky platforming really refreshing. It was the vacation I needed from the grim-dark kill-a-thons.


			<b>Quibbles:</b>

			The mini-games range from endearing to hair-pullingly difficult. Some of the jumping is difficult because distance is hard to gauge due to the perspective. While the difficulty was probably intentional, isometric jumping feels a little unfair sometimes. 


			<b>Recommendation:</b>

			The game is currently on Game Pass for PC, which I already heartily recommend. Definitely check this one out!
