			Soul Blazer is often considered part of an unofficial trilogy with Illusion of Gaia and Terranigma. However, it feels more like a sequel to ActRaiser than ActRaiser 2 did, and has a lot in common the title, thematically and technically (sound effects).

			<b>Overview:</b>

			In ActRaiser and Soul Blazer, the playable character is an avatar sent by The Master to restore the world. The perspective is a little different as in ActRaiser, the player is The Master. Regardless, the high-level concept is the same: kill monsters, restore towns. But where ActRaiser has two distinct modes, Soul Blazer streamlines the town building aspect even further.

			In Soul Blazer, players simply clear out monster dens to proceed. Clearing in a den has two effects. It destroys that den forever, and then one of several other things can happen. Usually, an NPC is returned to town, but sometimes a new pathway or treasure opens. The overall meta-game here is fun. It is satisfying to rebuild the town and solve (relatively easy) puzzles as you rid the dungeons of monster lairs. Clearing the lairs is satisfying as well because the monsters do not come back. This is rather unique for games of the era, and even today.

			The localization is surprisingly solid, especially for the era, but the story and many of its characters are forgettable. I was only unsure of what to do next near the end of the game. But, there are guides for a reason.


			<b>Gameplay is O-kay:</b>


			The moment-to-moment gameplay is where the game suffers the most. Many of the monster dens, and some of the bosses, can be tackled by merely holding the shoulder button and standing in the right spot. 


			Item progression is better, but not by a lot. The decision making is as follows: “is monster metal?”, use metal monster slaying sword. The difficulty does ramp up, especially near the end. I found myself a little frustrated at the contrast between how easy most of the game is compared to the final handful of bosses.


			<b>Recommendation:</b>


			I recommend checking this game out, but not stressing over finishing it (I finished in around 12 hours). I think that the destroy monster den – rebuild the town game loop deserves a comeback. I would love to see it done as simply as it is in Soul Blazer, but with more memorable characters and stronger combat. It would make a great indy title, if they could stop themselves from making it a rogue-like/lite.
