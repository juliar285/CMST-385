			I had a week-long staycation to play some retro games. Here is a quick recap of what I checked out!

			<b>Xenosaga Episode 1 (PS2 Slim):</b>

			A PS2 game that feels very PS2. The story is intentionally confusing for no other reason than to appear cleaver. Character progression is very confusing with many different experience points to keep track of. The voice acting is Anime-dub bad. The combat animations were slow, and bosses were needlessly difficult. The game has a very slow start.


			I kinda loved it. It started off slow but kept building steam as it went on. While the story continues into the next games, and I was told to treat the trilogy like one big game, the plot felt like it ended where it needed to. I am looking forward to playing Part 2 soon.





			<b>Okami HD (Switch)</b>

			This is a game that I missed back in 2006. By then I was knee deep in World of Warcraft and had moved on from my PS2. If I had not known better, I could have been convinced that this was a 2018 game. I had several issues with Issun, but nothing that has not been said before. He is sexist and juvenile, and handholds the player through every single “puzzle” in the game. 


			Perhaps the biggest problem I had was when he forgot to tell me how to do something during the quest to find the Canine Warriors. After finding the dogs, many of them will ask for food. I thought I needed to find a unique item in town, it is an important quest after all. You feed many animals in Okami, but surely these will be special! I thought. Just in case, however, I bought some extra meat from the vender. Still nothing. I tried finding all five of them, hoping for an event where I then find the food. That was not it (you do not even find the fifth one until you feed the first four). 


			Eventually I caved and looked up the answer. You must go into the menu and use the meat while standing near the Canine Warrior. Up to this point there are no other items in the game used this way. It was frustrating to no end that the game made me feel so stupid for so long… but it was just a poor UI design decision. Issun, you could have told me!





			<b>Super Mario 64 (Switch)</b>

			I do not usually play games for the nostalgia hit. I play retro games because I still enjoy them in the here and now. Mario 64 does several things really well considering how old it is. Though I remember that, even back then, I thought the art and level design was a weird hodgepodge of random elements. Some textures are attempting photorealism, some are cartoony (I understand they used stock textures to create this game).

			The emulation is solid enough, but either age or input lag caused me to fall off a few ledges. The Switch conversion falls short in one major way: the analog stick. Because the Switch does not have the octagonal groove, it can be hard to run in the direction the game means for you to. 





			<b>Super Mario Sunshine (Switch)</b>

			The game feels emulated (it is), though I cannot put my finger on what feels wrong. But good news! They inverted the camera from the GameCube release. So, I can finally play this one after all these years. I played through the first few worlds when it came out but got frustrated. I see why, this is probably the hardest 3D Mario game… if not the hardest Mario game I have played. Having a camera that controlled the opposite of what I expected would have made this unplayable (Note: options are a part of good design).


			The game is very high quality, but there are a few points of criticism that I totally understand. F.L.U.D.D feels like a single-level gimmick, not a full game gimmick. Especially after seeing all the creativity in Mario Galaxy, 3D World, and Odyssey. There are not enough levels and they are one-note, everything is an island paradise.  Lastly, again, the game is hard. Mario is best when the critical path is easy, but there are a lot of difficult bonus challenges.





			<b>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (Switch)</b>

			This game is great to relax to, but I have only finished the first part. Most of the difficulty arises from figuring out what to do, not in execution. The game is divided into easily digestible chunks and looks and runs great in handheld mode. So, I find it the perfect second screen game for while I am watching YouTube shows. I will be playing this one for a long time, I think.


			<b>Modern Releases</b>

			With so many great options for older games, I have not played a current gen release since Ghost of Tsushima. I eagerly await Demon’s Souls, though it is not exactly new (and I do not have a PS5 pre-order yet). I have completed Demon’s Souls a few times, but I still love it.
